## Step 1 -- Setup a basic Web server

We need a server running before we can do anything.
* Create a new npm project
* Install `hapi` and `inert`
* Create a simple Hapi server that serves up a 'Hello World' `html` file at `/`
* Create a `config.env` file for your project and store your server address in a variable called `BASE_URL`
