# OAuth workshop

In this workshop we will be using the [OAuth 2 protocol](https://oauth.net/2/) to authorise a user logging in to our app. This method of authorisation uses a 3rd party API (in this case, Github). The full OAuth guide for github can be found [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/) and you may find this article, [OAuth 2 simplified article](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified), quite helpful.

Do _NOT_ copy and paste _anything_ from your previous workshops or projects. You may look at these to remind you of syntax, but make sure you are writing each and every line yourself. :grin: This will help you to remember all of the server methods, and make you think about what each one is really doing. It also stops you from copying in code with typos or pieces that aren't relevant to this workshop :yum:

Pair up and swap driver/navigator at each step.
